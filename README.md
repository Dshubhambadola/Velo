## 🏁 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- **Go**: v1.21 or higher
- **Node.js**: v18 or higher
- **Docker** (Optional, for containerized database)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-org/velo.git
    cd velo
    ```

2.  **Configure Environment Variables:**
    Create a `.env` file in the root directory (based on `.env.example`).
    ```ini
    # Database
    DATABASE_URL="host=localhost user=postgres password=postgres dbname=velo port=5432 sslmode=disable"
    REDIS_URL="localhost:6379"

    # Auth
    JWT_SECRET="your-secret-key"

    # Email Service (SendGrid)
    SENDGRID_API_KEY="SG.your_api_key"
    SENDGRID_FROM_EMAIL="no-reply@velo.com"
    SENDGRID_FROM_NAME="Velo Team"

    # Google SSO
    GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID="your-google-client-id"
    GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET="your-google-client-secret"
    GOOGLE_REDIRECT_URL="http://localhost:8080/auth/sso/callback"

    # Payment Provider (Circle)
    CIRCLE_API_KEY="your-circle-api-key"
    CIRCLE_SANDBOX="true"
    ```

3.  **Install Backend Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    go mod download
    ```

3.  **Install Frontend Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    cd web
    npm install
    cd ..
    ```

### Running the Application

We use a `Makefile` to simplify common tasks.

1.  **Start the Backend Services:**
    You can run services individually or all together. For development, start the Gateway:
    ```bash
    make run-gateway
    ```
    *Note: Ensure your database environment variables are set or use the default SQLite configuration.*

2.  **Start the Frontend:**
    ```bash
    cd web
    npm run dev
    ```
    The application will be available at `http://localhost:5173`.

## 🧪 Testing

### Backend Unit Tests
We use usage `testing` package and `testify` for assertions.
```bash
make test
```
This runs all unit tests across `auth`, `payroll`, and `wallet` services.

### Frontend E2E Tests
We use **Playwright** for comprehensive end-to-end testing.
```bash
cd web
npx playwright test
```
To run the tests in UI mode:
```bash
npx playwright test --ui
```
